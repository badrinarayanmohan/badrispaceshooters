# Space Shooters
Space shooters is a modern two Dimension game implementing a strong concept of C# coding and good understanding of game engines. There are various game engines to satisfy the needs of a game developer, in this project, we have used a game engine called Unity. Unity is a contemplary game engine which is simple to understand and user friendly through which Space shooters was designed. The games objective is very simple as to destroying the enemy space crafts and not getting ourselves destroyed meanwhile. Its developed as a single infinite level game with enemy space crafts randomly spawning in front of the user  to attack. The algorithm designed for the enemy projectiles was monodeveloped and is randomised so that the player cannot judge a rhythm to the motion of the enemy. Game development is a vast field where we develop games which is aimed for all ages for leisure. The game development process be it small or large scale, takes immense time and is a needs passion and dedication.
